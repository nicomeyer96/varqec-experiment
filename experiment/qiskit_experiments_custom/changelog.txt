parallel_experiment:
    - imports custom composite_experiment, base_experiment, composite_analysis
    - propagates use of Qiskit Session to composite_experiment

composite_experiment:
    - imports custom base_experiment, composite_analysis
    - propagates use of Qiskit Session to base_experiment

base_experiment:
    - allows the usage of Qiskit Session (beneath direct execution on backend)
    - separates 'run' method into
        - a 'submit' method that submits the jobs in a non-blocking fashion and returns the ob_ids
        - a 'retrieve' method that waits for execution of the jobs in a blocking fashion and triggers the analysis

batch_experiment:
    - imports custom composite_experiment, base_experiment, composite_analysis

mit_qst_experiment:
    - imports custom mitigated_tomography_analysis, batch_experiment
    - propagates resample flag to mit_tomography_analysis

mit_tomography_analysis:
    - imports custom composite_analysis
    - propagates resample flag to composite_analysis

composite_analysis:
    - Added 'resample' flag to '_component_experiment_data method', propagates to '_marginalized_component_data'
    - Adapted '_marginalized_component_data' method
        - removed '_format_memory' call (to enable IQM experiments)
        - removed logging of memory (to enable IQM experiments)
        - added possibility for cluster re-sampling
    - Added `_resample` method that performs cluster re-sampling
